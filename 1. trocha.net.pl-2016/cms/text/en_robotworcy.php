<h1>Robotics and programming</h1>
	Robotworcy.pl - my proprietary project supporting robotics and programming among children over 5 years of age. Classes take place in KIdsâ€™ Clubs for and Pre-schools. In addition to creating structures with Lego WeDo 2.0, children learn to program, mainly in Scratch software. At the moment classes are suspended until further notice due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
