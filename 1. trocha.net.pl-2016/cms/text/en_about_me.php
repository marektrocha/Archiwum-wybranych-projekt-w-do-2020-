<h1>Years with passion</h1>
Anyone who remembers the beginnings of the FrontPage95 application knows that it did not always meet all expectations. Hence, some time later I started to create my first HTML projects and I managed to maintain one of my very own recovered archival projects  <a style="color:#90c0db; font-weight:bold;" href="../old_2006/003.html" target="_blank"><u>trocha.net.pl</u></a> (2006).<BR><BR>

In the following years, while implementing other projects, I learned the insights of CSS. Each subsequent web application was based on improved solutions, including an online shop based on WooCommerce, design patterns in PHP, both standard internet payments and recurring payments. Below, you can find some of my projects.
